# sequalizedBurger
A sequalized version of the Eat-A-Burger App

## Description of Project

This project is designed to illustrate the MVC development method and to further expand my knowledge of express.js, rendering engines, and improve my proficiency working on a full stack application. 

The app is fairly straightforward. There is basic styling and a layout rendered using handlebars in html that shows a list of desired burgers to be eaten, and interface to show them as eaten, and a list to show the burgers that have already been eaten. 

The burgers are stored in a MySQL database and the results are rendered using the table in the aforementioned database. 

The primary challenge was building out the ORM. I used the examples from the Cats App example in class for most of my code as it was a fully functional model in the end.
